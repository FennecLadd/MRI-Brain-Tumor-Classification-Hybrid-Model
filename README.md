# MRI-Brain-Tumor-Classification-Hybrid-Model
This project implements a hybrid deep learning architecture combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Liquid Neural Networks (LNN) for multi-class classification of brain MRI images into 38 distinct tumor categories.
